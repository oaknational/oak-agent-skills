# Accessibility: web pages and interactive content

For HTML/web output, forms, and anything clickable — including **quizzes** (starter/exit/unit) and
other interactive learning content. This is where the WCAG 2.2 additions bite hardest.

## Structure and semantics

- **Real landmarks and headings.** Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and a correct
  heading hierarchy (one `<h1>`, then `<h2>`/`<h3>` in order). Don't fake headings/buttons with
  styled `<div>`s.
- **Native elements first.** Use `<button>`, `<a href>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<table>` with
  `<th>` — they bring keyboard support, roles, and states for free. Reach for ARIA only to fill a
  gap, and follow "no ARIA is better than bad ARIA".
- **Page title** describes the page; **language** is set on `<html lang>`.

## Keyboard and focus

- **Everything operable by keyboard**, in a logical tab order, with **no keyboard traps**.
- **Visible focus indicator** on every interactive element (2.4.7), and the focused element is not
  hidden behind sticky headers/overlays (**2.4.11**, new in 2.2).
- Provide a **skip-to-content** link for pages with repeated navigation.

## Pointer, target size, and motion

- **Target size ≥ 24×24 CSS px** (**2.5.8**, new) for buttons, links, quiz options, icon controls —
  or ensure adequate spacing. The most common new failure.
- **Dragging has a tap/click alternative** (**2.5.7**, new) — e.g. drag-and-drop matching questions
  also work by select-then-place.
- No essential action depends on a device gesture/motion only.

## Forms and quizzes

- **Every input has a programmatic `<label>`** (or equivalent); instructions aren't placeholder-only.
- **Don't convey correct/incorrect by colour alone** — pair green/red with a word and/or icon
  ("Correct", "Try again", ✓/✗). This is the single most common quiz failure (1.4.1).
- **Errors are identified in text** and suggest a fix (3.3.1/3.3.3); group related fields with
  `<fieldset>`/`<legend>`.
- **Redundant entry** (**3.3.7**, new): don't ask pupils to re-type something already provided in
  the same flow.
- **Accessible authentication** (**3.3.8**, new): no login step that's a cognitive puzzle.
- Quiz timers: if timed, make the limit adjustable/extendable (2.2.1), or avoid time limits.

## Colour, contrast, and zoom

- Text **4.5:1** (large text/UI/graphics **3:1**); **Oak's target is 7:1**.
- **Non-text contrast 3:1** for control boundaries, focus rings, and meaningful graphics (1.4.11).
- Usable at **200% zoom** and **reflows to one column at 320px** (1.4.4/1.4.10); never set
  `user-scalable=no`.

## Embedded media and motion

What the code controls about video, audio and animation:

- **Captions.** Video players load and expose synchronised captions (WCAG 1.2.2, A), with a visible
  control to turn them on. Don't ship a player that can't show the captions the content has.
- **Transcripts.** Audio-only media links to a transcript (1.2.1, A). For video, a transcript link is
  strongly recommended, and placed next to the player.
- **No autoplay with sound.** If media plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, provide a pause/
  stop/mute control (2.2.2); better, don't autoplay with sound at all.
- **Pause controls.** Moving, looping or auto-updating content, such as carousels and looping
  animations or GIFs, can be paused, stopped or hidden (2.2.2).
- **No flashing** more than **three times per second** (2.3.1). This is a seizure-safety criterion,
  not a nicety. Check animated explainers and transitions.
- **Respect reduced motion.** Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`, and avoid large parallax or
  auto-motion that can trigger vestibular issues. Animation must not carry information that's
  unavailable in text.
- Player controls themselves meet the rest of this page: keyboard operable, labelled, visible focus
  and large enough targets.

## Status and live updates

- **Status messages** (e.g. "Answer saved", "3 of 10 correct") are announced to assistive tech
  without moving focus (4.1.3).
