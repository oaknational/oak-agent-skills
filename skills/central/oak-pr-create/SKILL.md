# Creating a pull request

Write a pull request that a reviewer can understand, test and approve without asking the author anything. The title says what the change does; the description says briefly why, and how to check it.

## Before you write

1. Check the branch. Stop if it's the default branch, or if it has no commits ahead of the branch it will merge into. If there are uncommitted changes, ask whether to commit them first. If the branch already has a pull request (`gh pr view`), update that one instead of opening another: see [Updating a pull request](#updating-a-pull-request).
2. Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` for its conventions, such as ticket references or required sections.
3. Look for a pull request template, usually `.github/pull_request_template.md`. If there is one, fill it in: use its sections, in its order, instead of the structure below.
4. Read the whole change against the branch it will merge into, for example with `git diff main...HEAD`, and read the commit messages.
5. Find the reason for the change: the linked issue, the conversation that led to it, or the author's explanation. If you can't tell why the change was made, ask rather than invent a reason.

## The title

Use a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) title, `type(scope): summary`, because many of our repositories squash-merge pull requests and the title becomes the commit on `main`. Write the summary in the imperative and lower case, without a full stop, such as `feat(search): add lesson filters`. Add `!` for a breaking change, and keep the title under about 72 characters. If the repository's `AGENTS.md` doesn't say whether titles include a ticket ID, ask the user rather than guessing from past titles.

## The description

Cover these two things, in this order. [Writing the description](references/pr-description.md) explains each one, with an example.

1. **What and why.** Two sentences, about 50 words: the problem or the old behaviour, then what the change does. For two or more separate changes, one line that sums them up, then a short bullet for each. Link the issue.
2. **Testing instructions.** [Testing instructions](references/testing-instructions.md) a reviewer can follow. If the change is user-facing, always include them, as explicit, plain-English steps QA can follow, each with what they should see.

Leave out anything the diff, the ticket or CI already shows. Add test evidence only when CI can't show it, in one line with a link.

## Rules

- Only claim what's true. If something wasn't tested, say so.
- Never include secrets, credentials, personal data or internal links that shouldn't be public. Many of our repositories are public.
- Link tickets and issues. Never leave a bare ticket number.
- If the template has a checklist, leave its items for the author to tick, and don't strike through any that could apply.
- For screenshots, leave a placeholder for the author, or write "N/A" with a reason of a few words. Give every image alt text that says what it shows.
- Write in plain British English for someone who hasn't seen the work. Define anything a reviewer outside the team might not know.

## Opening the pull request

Pushing and opening a pull request are visible to other people, so never do either without the user's approval.

1. Run the repository's checks, such as formatting, linting, type checking and tests, using the commands in `AGENTS.md`. If one fails, stop, show its output and offer to fix it. Report which checks ran, and never say a check passed if it didn't run. If the branch changes after the checks ran, run them again before pushing.
2. Show the user the title, the description, the branch it merges into, the current branch and the commits it contains. Revise them as the user asks, showing the whole updated version each time, until they clearly approve it. Silence or a vague reply isn't approval. Then ask whether to push and open it, and whether as a draft, and don't go on until they say yes.
3. Push only the current branch: `git push -u origin HEAD`.
4. Open the pull request with the GitHub CLI, passing the description from a file so the shell can't change it: `gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file <file>`. Add `--draft` if the user asked for one, and `--base <branch>` if it doesn't merge into the default branch.
5. Don't request reviewers or add assignees unless the user asks you to.
6. Give the user the pull request's link.
7. Offer to watch its CI checks. Only watch if the user says yes. Run `gh pr checks <number> --watch`, in the background if you can, so the user isn't blocked. When the checks finish, say which passed and which failed, and offer to investigate any failure. If they're still running after about 15 minutes, stop watching, say so, and offer to keep going.

If `gh` isn't installed or signed in, give the user the title and description to paste instead.

## Updating a pull request

When the change grows or its approach changes after review, update the title and description so they still describe what will merge. Show the user the new version and wait for their approval, as when opening one, then apply it with `gh pr edit --title "<title>" --body-file <file>`.
