description: Threat-models a code change for security, covering authorisation, input handling, secrets and dependencies, and keeping personal data and secrets out of code, logs and errors. Use when a change touches sign-in, permissions, user input, data access, APIs, configuration, logging, dependencies or CI workflows, or when asked for a security review.

# Security review

Find the ways a change could let someone do something they shouldn't, or expose something that should stay private. Focus on real, reachable problems, and explain each one well enough that the author can fix it.

Our tooling already scans for secrets, vulnerable dependencies and unsafe workflow patterns. This review adds the judgement those tools can't: who can reach the new code, what they control, and what they could do with it.

## Before you start

1. Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` for its architecture, how it authenticates people, and where it stores data.
2. Get the whole change against the branch it will merge into, for example with `git diff main...HEAD`.
3. Find out what the change is for, from the pull request description or linked issue.

## How to review

### 1. Map what the change exposes

- **Entry points:** new or changed routes, API endpoints, server actions, form handlers, webhooks, queue consumers, scheduled jobs, CLI commands and CI workflows.
- **Who can reach them:** anyone on the internet, signed-in users, particular roles, other services, or only the team.
- **What they control:** request bodies, query strings, headers, cookies, uploaded files, URLs, values from other services, and anything stored earlier by another user.
- **What's at stake:** personal data, accounts and permissions, content people rely on, money or usage costs, and credentials.

### 2. Follow untrusted data

Trace each value an outsider controls from where it enters to everywhere it's used. Problems appear where untrusted data reaches something that trusts it: a database query, a shell command, a file path, an outbound request, HTML, a redirect or a log.

### 3. Check each area

Work through these areas, using [the checklist](references/checklist.md) for the detailed questions.

- **Authentication and authorisation.** Every action checks, on the server, that the person is signed in where required and is allowed to act on this particular record. Access is denied by default.
- **Input handling.** Input is validated at the boundary against a schema, and untrusted values never become part of a query, command, path, URL or HTML without the right parameterisation or encoding.
- **Secrets.** No credentials in code, tests, fixtures, configuration committed to the repository, client-side bundles, logs or error messages. Secrets come from the environment or a secret store.
- **Personal data.** Collect and keep only what's needed. Never write personal data, such as names, email addresses, pupil information or IP addresses, to logs, analytics, error reports or URLs.
- **Dependencies.** New dependencies are needed, maintained, widely used, correctly named, and don't run install scripts without a reason. Versions are locked.
- **Web and API behaviour.** Cookies, cross-origin rules, security headers, rate limits and error responses are set safely.
- **CI and automation.** Workflows don't run untrusted code with secrets or write permissions, and don't put untrusted values straight into shell commands.

### 4. Check before you claim

For each possible problem, confirm it's reachable: name who could trigger it, through which input, and what they'd gain. Check whether a framework, middleware, schema or caller already prevents it. If you can't confirm it, report it as a question or a risk, not a vulnerability.

## Reporting findings

Lead with a short summary of the overall risk. Then list findings, most severe first:

| Severity | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical | Exploitable now, by an outsider, with serious impact such as account takeover or a data breach. Must be fixed before merging. |
| High     | Exploitable with some conditions, or serious impact for a narrower group. Must be fixed before merging.                       |
| Medium   | Real weakness with limited impact or hard to exploit. Fix soon.                                                               |
| Low      | Hardening that reduces risk further.                                                                                          |

For each finding, give:

- where it is, as `path/to/file.ts:42`;
- who can exploit it, how, and what they'd gain, without a working attack payload;
- the fix, with a short code example if it helps.

Also say what you couldn't check, such as configuration outside the repository or infrastructure settings.

## If you find a real secret

Don't repeat the secret in your output, in full or in part. Say where it is, tell the author it must be treated as exposed and rotated, even if the commit is removed, and suggest how to load it from the environment instead.

## Scope

This skill is guidance on top of deterministic tooling, such as secret scanning, dependency audits and workflow linting. It doesn't replace them, and a clean review doesn't mean those checks can be skipped.
