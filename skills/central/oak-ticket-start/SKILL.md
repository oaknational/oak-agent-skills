# Starting a ticket

Start work from a Linear ticket: help the user pick one, read it out, create a branch for it, and mark it as started. Ask for approval before creating the branch, and don't change anything else.

- Create the branch locally and never push it. There's nothing to push until there's work to ship, and opening the pull request is `oak-pr-create`'s job.
- In Linear, this skill only moves the chosen ticket to In Progress once the branch exists, and assigns it to the user if they agree. Don't change its description or comments.
- Never show names or email addresses from Linear. Refer to people by role.

This skill needs the Linear MCP server. If its tools aren't available, say so, ask the user to paste the ticket's text, and continue from [Step 3](#step-3-read-out-the-ticket).

## Step 1: work out the scope

The user's message may include:

- **a ticket identifier**, such as `ENG-123`. Go straight to [Step 3](#step-3-read-out-the-ticket);
- **a base branch** to start from instead of the default branch. Step 4 still confirms it.

Find where to list tickets from, in this order:

1. A Linear team or project named in the repository's `AGENTS.md`.
2. A team or project the user names.
3. Otherwise, call `list_teams`, suggest the closest match to the repository, and ask.

## Step 2: list the tickets ready to start

Call `get_user` with `"me"` to learn the user's id. Then call `list_issues` for the team or project three times, once for each state type: `started`, `unstarted` and `backlog`. Pass `fields: ["id","title","priority","status","statusType","assigneeId"]`, and page through the results while `hasNextPage` is true.

A team can have several `started` states. Keep only the one for active work, such as In Progress, and leave out review states, such as In Review: they aren't work to start.

Show one numbered list, grouped In Progress, then Todo, then Backlog, and within each group ordered Urgent, High, Medium, Low, then no priority. Give each ticket one line: its identifier, its priority and its title.

```text
**In Progress**
1. ENG-110  --      Add a health check endpoint
2. ENG-115  --      Cache the search results page  (someone else's)

**Todo**
3. ENG-126  Urgent  Fix the broken sign-in redirect
4. ENG-123  High    Add filters to lesson search

**Backlog**
5. ENG-122  --      Remove the old analytics script
```

In Progress comes first, because people often move a ticket on the board before starting it. Mark an In Progress ticket assigned to someone else as `(someone else's)`, without naming them, so the user doesn't start work that's already under way.

Then stop and wait for the user to choose, by number or identifier.

## Step 3: read out the ticket

Call `get_issue` with the identifier and `includeRelations: true`, because the list shortens descriptions. Then give the user:

- one sentence on what the ticket asks for and why;
- **the acceptance criteria, quoted word for word as a checklist.** The work is judged against them, so don't paraphrase. If the ticket has none, say so, and list what it does specify as the scope;
- any constraints, and the tickets blocking this one, flagging any blocker that isn't done.

## Step 4: confirm the branch name and base

Propose both in one message, and wait until the user approves both:

```text
Branch:  feat/ENG-123-lesson-search-filters
Base:    main  (the default; name another branch if this work builds on it)
```

- **Branch name.** Follow the convention in `AGENTS.md` if it has one. Otherwise use `<type>/<TICKET-ID>-<slug>`: `feat`, or `fix` or `chore` when the ticket is clearly a bug fix or a chore. Make the slug from the title's distinctive words, in lowercase, joined by single hyphens, about 20 characters long, without cutting a word.
- **Base.** The repository's default branch (`git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`), unless the user named another. If they name another, check it exists with `git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <base>` before going further.

## Step 5: create the branch

1. Run `git status --porcelain`. If there are uncommitted changes, show them and ask whether to stash them. Only if the user agrees, run `git stash push -u -m "oak-ticket-start: <TICKET-ID>"` and tell them `git stash pop` brings the changes back. If they don't agree, stop.
2. Fetch, then branch from the fetched base, so the branch starts from the latest version rather than a stale local copy:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git switch -c <branch> origin/<base>
   ```

## Step 6: move the ticket to In Progress

Only once the branch exists, call `save_issue` with the identifier and `state: "In Progress"`. If the team has no state with that name, use its active `started` state.

Skip this when the ticket is already In Progress or further along, such as In Review or Done: never move a ticket backwards.

Tell the user which state the ticket moved from, or that it was left as it was. If the update fails, say so plainly: the branch exists, but the board doesn't show the work has started.

If the ticket has no assignee, ask whether to assign it to the user, and only if they agree, call `save_issue` with `assignee: "me"`. Never reassign a ticket that already has an assignee.

## Step 7: offer to plan

Confirm the branch exists locally and hasn't been pushed. Then offer to plan the work against the acceptance criteria from Step 3, in the agent's planning mode if it has one. Don't switch into planning mode until the user agrees.
