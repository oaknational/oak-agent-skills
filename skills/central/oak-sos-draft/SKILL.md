# Scrum of Scrums report

Draft the ticket-based half of a squad's Scrum of Scrums update from Linear. The audience is the other squads, so the report says what the squad did, what it will do next, who it needs things from, and what another squad should know.

The report also carries product and organisation content that isn't in Linear and that only the user has. Don't invent it. Every claim must trace to Linear or to the notes you were given; mark every gap with `[TODO ...]`. The examples in this file show a shape, not a fact, so never copy a phrase from them into the report.

The step that adds the most value: the previous meeting's "Upcoming goals and priorities" are the strongest candidates for this meeting's "Accomplishments". Check each one against Linear before promoting it.

This skill needs the Linear MCP server. If its tools aren't available, say so and stop.

## Inputs

Read these from the user's message:

1. **The previous meeting's notes**, pasted in. They are required: reconciling against them is the point of the skill. Use notes pasted earlier in the conversation if there are any. Don't read them from a file or search the disk for an old report. If there are none, ask for them and stop.
2. **A start date**, optional, as `since:YYYY-MM-DD`. Remove it before treating the rest as notes.
3. **The squad's Linear team**, optional, as a team key or name.

When you ask for the notes, say that they're this squad's bulleted list from the last Scrum of Scrums, and show the outline from [Output format](#output-format) so it's unambiguous. Then wait. Don't call Linear in the meantime: the notes decide the squad, the workstreams and their labels.

## Step 1: the window and the team

- The window ends today and starts 14 days earlier, unless `since:` set the start. Work the dates out from the system clock.
- Take the squad's name, and any emoji shortcode after it, from the top bullet of the notes. The report's top bullet copies it, keeping the shortcode as literal text, such as `:rocket:`, so it renders wherever the report is pasted.
- Find the squad's Linear team. Use the team the user named. Otherwise call `list_teams` and look for a team whose name or key matches the squad's name. A squad can own more than one team. If no team clearly matches, list the candidates and ask.
- Resolve each team's id with `get_team`, because `list_cycles` needs the id, not the key.
- Before fetching anything else, state the window and the teams you'll use.

## Step 2: pull from Linear

For each team, make these calls:

1. `list_issues` with the team, `updatedAt: "-P16D"` (2 days more than the window), `limit: 250`, and `fields: ["id","title","status","statusType","project","labels","priority","createdAt","updatedAt","startedAt","completedAt","canceledAt","cycleId","url"]`.
2. `list_cycles` with the team id and `type: "current"`, to learn the current cycle's id.
3. `list_projects` with the team and `fields: ["id","name","status"]`.
4. `get_status_updates` with `type: "project"`, `createdAt: "-P14D"`, and `project` set to each project in turn. Filter by project, because an unfiltered call returns other teams' updates. An empty result is normal.

Don't request assignee fields.

Fetch a single issue with `get_issue` only where its title is too short to summarise. Add `includeRelations: true` when checking a ticket for blocking relations to another team.

If any list call returns `hasNextPage: true`, page through it. Never report from a partial list.

## Step 3: sort the tickets

Sort them yourself from the timestamps. Never sort on `updatedAt`: bulk status changes update it, so a ticket updated in the window isn't evidence of work.

- **Shipped:** `statusType` is `completed` and `completedAt` is inside the window.
- **In flight:** `statusType` is `started` now. This covers both in-progress and in-review states; keep the difference, because it changes how a bullet is worded.
- **Queued next:** every `unstarted` ticket, plus any `backlog` ticket in the current cycle. Many teams rarely set priority or labels, so don't rely on either to find or group tickets.
- **Dropped:** `canceledAt` is inside the window. Mention one only if it changes the story.
- **Ignore:** backlog tickets outside a cycle that say nothing about the next fortnight.

Read the rest of the backlog anyway. Where several tickets created this fortnight describe one coherent next piece of work, that work belongs under Upcoming, as work that's planned but not yet scheduled.

Two timestamps mislead:

- `completedAt` is when the ticket was closed in Linear, which can lag the merge, and tickets are often closed in batches. Don't present it as a delivery date.
- `startedAt` is when a ticket last moved from an unstarted state into a started one, not when it entered review. A ticket sent back to Todo and restarted gets a new `startedAt`, so it can postdate earlier work. `In flight since <date>` is supportable as the latest restart; `in review since <date>` isn't. Read `get_issue`'s state history if a bullet needs the first start or the real review date.

## Step 4: reconcile against the previous notes

Classify every bullet under the notes' "Upcoming goals and priorities":

- **Landed:** shipped tickets clearly cover it. Move it to Accomplishments, in the past tense, worded from what the tickets say rather than what the goal predicted.
- **Partly landed:** some covering tickets shipped and others are in flight. Put the shipped part in Accomplishments and keep the rest under Upcoming.
- **No ticket evidence:** carry it forward under Upcoming, marked `[TODO confirm]`. Much of a squad's work is never ticketed, so a missing ticket doesn't mean no progress.

Then add anything shipped that no previous goal anticipated.

Drop any shipped ticket whose ground the previous notes' Accomplishments already cover: tickets are often closed a day or two after the work was reported.

Carry forward the notes' cross-team dependencies, marked `[TODO confirm]`: a dependency doesn't disappear because nobody mentioned it. Don't carry risks forward the same way. Squads clear a risk once it stops mattering, so offer one again only if Linear says it's still live.

## Step 5: write each section

Group by workstream, using the labels the previous notes used rather than Linear's project names, so the report reads continuously from meeting to meeting. Work out which project maps to which label from the notes each time. Where nothing matches, use the project's name. Within a workstream, group tickets into 2 to 4 themes inferred from their titles, such as infrastructure, data, the user interface or integrations.

A squad's work is wider than its Linear projects, and some workstreams in the notes will have no tickets at all. Carry a workstream only where there's something to say, never invent one, and list any workstream from the notes that has gone quiet in the appendix, for the user to decide. A maintenance workstream is the exception: it's standing work, so it keeps its line every time, describing the activity ("Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes") rather than whichever small ticket is open.

### Accomplishments since the last meeting

The shipped tickets plus the promoted goals. One bullet per theme, not per ticket, and no ticket IDs. Where a workstream's milestone has landed, the milestone is the whole entry, and the tasks that fed it are dropped. Only do this when Linear or the notes say it landed. A milestone without evidence stays under Upcoming, as the goal it still is.

### Upcoming goals and priorities

The in-flight and queued tickets, plus goals carried forward. A flat list of short noun phrases, around 9 per workstream and never more than 12, with no sub-headings. If an item is too uncertain to list plainly, leave it out and mention it in the appendix.

### Any known cross-team dependencies

Name the team, not the system: `<team> for <what we need from them>`, such as "Platform team for a new staging environment". Leave out the technical detail: the room wants to know who is on the hook. Around 4 bullets, one per team, merging any two lines that name the same team. Linear rarely names the other team, so expect the user to rewrite most of these. Mark `[TODO confirm]` only on the ones you couldn't ground in a ticket. Keep a dependency that's real but not live yet, and say it's coming.

### Any known risks

Only risks another squad would act on. For each candidate, ask: would another squad's lead do anything differently on hearing it? If not, leave it out.

Never include sprint mechanics or delivery metrics: cycle scope growth, burndown, completion counts, review queue length, how long a ticket has been in a state, ticket ages or throughput. Anyone who cares can already see them in Linear.

Risks that qualify include squad capacity and absence, an undecided question that blocks someone else, a dependency that might slip, and an unknown that could change another team's scope. Linear holds none of these, so offer at most one candidate, marked `[TODO confirm]`, and default to `N/A`.

## Style

One clause per bullet, around 15 to 20 words. Name tools freely. Where a bullet groups several things, use a colon and a list: "Search service: a query API, an indexing job and the first ranking rules".

Leave out:

- **The route taken.** "Search index built", not how it moved between libraries or was reworked along the way.
- **How it was checked.** "Sign-in flow tested end to end", not the branch or environment it ran against.
- **The reason.** Nothing after "so that" or "now that".
- **The steps.** One bullet is one thing, not a thing and its parts.
- **Status.** Nothing finer than done or not done, so no "(in review)".
- **Filler verbs.** "Search service", not "Search service stood up".
- **Anything a sibling bullet already says.**

In Accomplishments, use the past tense and 1 to 5 bullets per workstream: fifteen shipped tickets compress to five. In Upcoming, use bare noun phrases. Reuse the previous notes' wording where it covers the same ground: continuity matters more than a fresh description.

## Output format

The same shape every time: one top bullet, then the four sections in this order, workstreams under each, and detail under those. Section bullets are headings, so never put content on them. Dependencies and risks sit directly under their section bullet, one line each.

```text
- <Squad name> <emoji shortcode from the notes, if any>
    - Accomplishments since the last meeting
        - <Workstream>
            - <what landed>
    - Upcoming goals and priorities
        - <Workstream>
            - <what is next>
    - Any known cross-team dependencies
        - <dependency> [TODO confirm]
    - Any known risks
        - N/A
```

- Keep all four section bullets even when one is empty. An empty section gets a single `N/A` child.
- Indent four spaces per level. A fifth level is fine where a workstream needs it.
- Put nothing above the top bullet: no title, date or introduction.
- Use plain Markdown lists only, so the structure carries the meaning. The squad's emoji shortcode on the top bullet is the only emoji allowed, and nothing depends on it.

## Step 6: report back

Don't write a file.

1. Print the report in the format above.
2. Below it, print an appendix that isn't part of the report:
   - the ticket IDs behind each Accomplishments bullet;
   - any shipped ticket left out because the previous notes already reported it;
   - how each previous goal was classified: landed, partly landed or no evidence;
   - any workstream carried forward without Linear evidence, or gone quiet;
   - anything removed under the personal data rule, so the user can put it back.
3. Offer to copy the report to the clipboard. If the user agrees, copy only the report, keeping its nesting, ready to paste into Notion: no headings, bold or blank lines inside the list, and plain text instead of code formatting.

## Rules

- **No personal data.** No names, email addresses or Linear usernames anywhere in the report, including the authors of status updates. Where a bullet carried forward names someone, keep what it says, drop the name, and list the removal in the appendix. This applies even if the previous notes name people.
- **One marker,** `[TODO ...]`, for everything the user must add or confirm.
- Write in British English.
